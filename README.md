Mohamed Shaaban -- Beer Game 

The beer game is a simulation of the supply chain system challenges.

This project was part of a Software Engineering class. I was asked to team up with one more person in 4 sprints of two weeks. We switched teams and codebases every two weeks. We were given the assignment by an industrial engineering and management professor at Jacobs. 

I worked on sprint 4 of this code base. documentation of every team is available.
